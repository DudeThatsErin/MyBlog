Hello! 👋🏻 My name is Erin Skidds. I am a Full Stack Software Engineer by trade, blogger by night. I am a wife and a cat mom to 2 fur babies, Nikki & Morgan.

I built this blog using Grav because I wanted something lightweight and easy to manage on my iPad, Desktop and iPhone. This blog uses GitHub and Hostinger to manage it and I write and maintain all of my posts in Obsidian.
